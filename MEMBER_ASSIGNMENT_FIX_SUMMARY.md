# Member Assignment Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed the "Assign to members" functionality in the EditTaskModal so that selecting team members actually toggles, shows as selected, and persists to storage. Pre-selected members now load correctly when reopening the modal.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Task Update Flow Issue
**Problem**: The `handleUpdateTask` function in `Projects.tsx` was extracting `assignedMemberIds` from task data and handling it separately, which could cause issues with persistence.

**Fix**: Simplified the update flow to pass all task data including `assignedMemberIds` directly to the `updateTask` function.

```typescript
// Before
const { assignedMemberIds, ...taskUpdates } = taskData;
await updateTask(id, taskUpdates);
if (assignedMemberIds !== undefined) {
  await assignMembers(id, assignedMemberIds);
}

// After
await updateTask(id, taskData);
```

### 2. Default Tasks Missing assignedMemberIds
**Problem**: Default tasks in `LocalTasksRepository.ts` didn't have the `assignedMemberIds` field initialized.

**Fix**: Added `assignedMemberIds: []` to all default tasks to ensure proper initialization.

```typescript
const DEFAULT_TASKS = [
  {
    // ... other fields
    assignedMemberIds: [], // Initialize with empty array
  },
  // ... other tasks
];
```

### 3. useEffect Dependency Issue
**Problem**: The TaskForm's useEffect was depending on the entire `task` object, which could cause unnecessary re-renders and state issues when switching between tasks.

**Fix**: Changed dependency to `task?.id` to ensure proper reset when switching between different tasks.

```typescript
// Before
}, [task, isOpen]);

// After
}, [task?.id, isOpen]); // Use task?.id to ensure reset when switching tasks
```

### 4. Member Selection UI Improvements
**Problem**: Member selection dropdown could close too quickly and had potential event bubbling issues.

**Fixes**:
- Increased onBlur timeout from 200ms to 300ms for better UX
- Added proper event handling to prevent bubbling
- Improved click handlers for member selection and removal

```typescript
// Added proper event handlers
const handleMemberClick = (e: React.MouseEvent, memberId: string) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  handleMemberToggle(memberId);
};

const handleRemoveMember = (e: React.MouseEvent, memberId: string) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  removeMember(memberId);
};
```

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Domain Model
- Task interface already has `assignedMemberIds: string[]` (default `[]`)
- Task entity properly defined with assignment field

### ✅ Repository / Persistence
- `LocalTasksRepository.update()` properly handles `assignedMemberIds`
- `TaskMapper` correctly serializes/deserializes assignment data
- Default tasks now include `assignedMemberIds: []`

### ✅ Edit Modal State (Controlled Selection)
- TaskForm maintains local `selectedMemberIds` state
- Properly loads existing assignments when editing
- Resets state when switching between tasks
- Handles member toggling correctly

### ✅ UI Components
- Member search and filtering works
- Dropdown shows selected state with checkmarks
- Selected members displayed as removable tags
- Proper event handling prevents bubbling issues

### ✅ Save/Update Flow
- TaskForm includes `assignedMemberIds` in task data
- Projects page properly updates tasks with assignments
- State updates correctly after save

### ✅ Pre-selection and Display
- TaskCard shows assigned members via `AssignedMembersDisplay`
- Edit modal pre-selects existing assignments
- Data persists across page reloads

## Testing Checklist

### Acceptance Tests ✅
- [x] Open existing task with assignments → members are pre-selected
- [x] Select/deselect members → checkboxes and chips reflect changes immediately
- [x] Click Update → modal closes, task card shows assigned members
- [x] Re-open modal → selections are persisted
- [x] Reload page → assignments remain (data saved to storage)
- [x] Members list scrolls; Update button always reachable
- [x] No pointer-events issues or double-firing events

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Controlled Member Selection**: Local state management with proper toggling
2. **Search and Filter**: Real-time member search functionality
3. **Visual Feedback**: Selected members shown with checkmarks and tags
4. **Persistent Storage**: Assignments saved to localStorage and survive reloads
5. **Pre-selection**: Existing assignments loaded when editing tasks
6. **Event Handling**: Proper event management prevents UI issues
7. **Responsive Design**: Scrollable lists with fixed headers/footers

## Files Modified

1. `src/presentation/pages/Projects.tsx` - Fixed task update flow
2. `src/infrastructure/storage/LocalTasksRepository.ts` - Added assignedMemberIds to default tasks
3. `src/presentation/components/Tasks/TaskForm.tsx` - Improved member selection UI and event handling

## Conclusion

The member assignment functionality is now fully implemented and working correctly. Users can:
- Assign multiple team members to tasks
- Search and filter team members
- See visual feedback for selections
- Have assignments persist across sessions
- Edit assignments with proper pre-selection

All requirements from the original goal have been met with a clean, maintainable implementation that follows the existing architecture patterns.
