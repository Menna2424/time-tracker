# Task Assignment Feature

## Overview

The task assignment feature allows admins to assign or unassign team members to/from tasks. This feature is implemented following Clean Architecture principles with proper separation of concerns.

## Features

### ✅ Implemented Features

1. **Task Assignment Display**
   - Each task shows assigned team members with their names
   - Displays up to 3 members with a "+X more" indicator for additional members
   - Shows member avatars and names in a clean, compact format

2. **Assignment Modal**
   - Click the "Assign Members" button (Users icon) on any task card
   - Modal shows all available team members with checkboxes
   - Select/deselect members to assign/unassign them
   - Real-time preview of current assignments

3. **Persistent Storage**
   - All assignments are saved in localStorage
   - Data persists between sessions
   - Simulates a real database for demonstration purposes

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - UI updates immediately when assignments change
   - No page refresh required
   - Optimistic updates for better UX

5. **Clean Architecture Implementation**
   - **Domain Layer**: Task entity with `assignedMemberIds` field
   - **Repository Layer**: `ITaskAssignmentRepository` interface and mock implementation
   - **Use Case Layer**: `useTaskAssignments` hook for business logic
   - **Presentation Layer**: Modal and display components

## Architecture

### Domain Layer
- **Task Entity**: Extended with `assignedMemberIds?: string[]` field
- **Repository Interface**: `ITaskAssignmentRepository` defines assignment operations

### Infrastructure Layer
- **MockTaskAssignmentRepository**: Implements localStorage-based persistence
- **Storage**: Uses `task_assignments` key in localStorage

### Application Layer
- **useTaskAssignments**: Hook providing assignment management functions
- **Business Logic**: Handles assignment/unassignment operations

### Presentation Layer
- **AssignMembersModal**: Modal for selecting team members
- **AssignedMembersDisplay**: Component showing assigned members
- **TaskCard**: Updated to show assignments and assignment button

## Usage

### For Admins

1. **Navigate to Projects Page**
   - Go to the Projects section in the application

2. **View Task Assignments**
   - Each task card shows assigned members below the task description
   - Members are displayed as badges with their first names

3. **Assign/Unassign Members**
   - Click the "Users" icon button on any task card
   - Modal opens with list of all team members
   - Check/uncheck members to assign/unassign them
   - Click "Save Assignments" to confirm changes

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Changes are immediately reflected in the UI
   - No page refresh needed

### Technical Implementation

#### Adding a New Assignment
```typescript
// In the Projects component
const handleAssignMembers = async (taskId: string, memberIds: string[]) => {
  await updateTaskAssignments(taskId, memberIds);
  // UI updates automatically
};
```

#### Displaying Assignments
```typescript
// In TaskCard component
<AssignedMembersDisplay assignedMembers={assignedMembers} />
```

## Data Structure

### Task Assignment Storage
```typescript
interface TaskAssignments {
  [taskId: string]: string[]; // memberIds[]
}
```

### Task Entity (Updated)
```typescript
interface Task {
  // ... existing fields
  assignedMemberIds?: string[]; // IDs of assigned team members
}
```

```

## Testing

The feature includes:
- TypeScript compilation checks
- Build verification
- localStorage persistence testing
- UI component testing

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Real Database Integration**: Replace localStorage with actual database
2. **Assignment History**: Track assignment changes over time
3. **Bulk Operations**: Assign multiple tasks at once
4. **Assignment Notifications**: Notify team members when assigned
5. **Assignment Permissions**: Role-based assignment controls
6. **Assignment Analytics**: Track assignment patterns and productivity

## Clean Architecture Compliance

✅ **Dependency Rule**: All dependencies point inward
✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has specific responsibilities
✅ **Testability**: Business logic is isolated and testable
✅ **Maintainability**: Clear interfaces and modular design
✅ **Scalability**: Easy to extend with new features

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Updates**: Only affected components re-render
- **Lazy Loading**: Team members loaded on demand
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, then syncs with storage
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and state
