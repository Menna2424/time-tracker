# Timer Stabilization Summary

## Problem Statement

After recent dashboard changes, the timer system experienced several critical issues:

1. **Workday timer and task timers lost sync** and/or reset on navigation
2. **Workday timer sometimes ticked faster** (e.g., 3 seconds per real second)
3. **Running task counters stopped updating live**, or reset on page change
4. **Multiple intervals running simultaneously** causing timer multiplication

## Root Cause Analysis

The issues were caused by:

1. **Multiple timer intervals** running simultaneously across different components
2. **Incorrect provider placement** - TimerProvider was not mounted at the app root
3. **Legacy timer hooks** creating duplicate intervals
4. **Components refreshing data** with their own intervals instead of relying on the global timer

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Provider Placement Fix

**File: `src/main.tsx`**
- Moved all providers to the app root level
- Ensured TimerProvider is mounted exactly once above Router
- Proper provider hierarchy: ThemeProvider → AuthProvider → WorkdayTimerProvider → TimerProvider → StatisticsProvider → BrowserRouter

**File: `src/App.tsx`**
- Removed duplicate providers
- Removed Router (now in main.tsx)
- Simplified component structure

### 2. Unified Timer Context Implementation

**File: `src/shared/context/TimerContext.tsx`**
- Implemented proper TimerContext with unified timer system
- Integrated with container use cases (startTaskTimer, stopTaskTimer)
- Added active session detection and state management
- Implemented storage change listeners for cross-tab synchronization
- Removed legacy countdown management (handled by use cases)

### 3. Global Timer Tick Stabilization

**File: `src/presentation/hooks/useGlobalTimerTick.ts`**
- Ensured single global interval (1Hz) with drift correction
- Proper cleanup and initialization logic
- Integration with TickActiveWorkSecond use case
- Removed legacy timer management methods

### 4. Component Interval Removal

**Files with intervals removed:**
- `src/presentation/pages/Projects.tsx` - Removed 2-second refresh interval
- `src/presentation/components/WorkdayTimer/WorkdayTimer.tsx` - Removed 2-second refresh interval
- `src/presentation/components/Common/UnifiedTimerDemo.tsx` - Removed 1-second refresh interval
- `src/application/useCases/useStartTimer.ts` - Removed legacy countdown interval

### 5. Legacy Hook Cleanup

**File: `src/application/useCases/useActiveTask.ts`**
- **DELETED** - This hook was creating duplicate intervals and conflicting with the unified timer system

**File: `src/presentation/components/Projects/ProjectCard.tsx`**
- Updated to use TimerContext instead of useActiveTask
- Fixed active task detection logic

### 6. Projects Page Integration

**File: `src/presentation/pages/Projects.tsx`**
- Integrated with new TimerContext
- Simplified start/stop timer logic
- Removed manual interval management
- Updated to use unified timer methods

## Architecture Principles Maintained

### Clean Architecture Compliance
- ✅ **Timer logic in use cases**: All timer logic remains in application layer
- ✅ **No timer logic in components**: Components only call use cases
- ✅ **Single responsibility**: Each use case handles one specific timer operation
- ✅ **Dependency inversion**: Components depend on interfaces, not implementations

### Single Source of Truth
- ✅ **One global timer**: Only useGlobalTimerTick creates intervals
- ✅ **Centralized state**: TimerContext manages active timer state
- ✅ **Unified persistence**: All timer data flows through repositories

## Timer Behavior Specification

### Global Timer (1Hz)
- **Single interval** in useGlobalTimerTick
- **Drift correction** using localStorage persistence
- **TickActiveWorkSecond** handles all timer logic
- **No multiplication** on route changes

### Workday Timer
- **Decrements only when tasks are running**
- **1 second per real second** (no acceleration)
- **Auto-stops tasks when workday reaches 0**
- **Persists state** across navigation

### Task Timers
- **Live current values** update every second
- **Totals persist** on stop
- **Single active task** at a time
- **Real-time UI updates** without intervals

### Start/Stop Logic
- **START_TASK**: Creates session, updates task.current values
- **STOP_TASK**: Moves current to totals, persists, zeros current
- **Auto-cleanup**: Global timer stops when no active tasks

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Tests
- [ ] Start task → Task time & earnings increment second-by-second
- [ ] Workday decreases second-by-second while task is running
- [ ] Navigate across Dashboard/Projects/Timer → counters keep running
- [ ] Stop task → current rolls into totals, persists
- [ ] Reload page → totals persisted, running state maintained
- [ ] No timer acceleration or multiplication
- [ ] Single active task enforcement

### Technical Verification
- [ ] Only one setInterval in useGlobalTimerTick
- [ ] No intervals in components or pages
- [ ] TimerProvider mounted once at root
- [ ] Clean Architecture maintained
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful

## Files Modified

### Core Architecture
- `src/main.tsx` - Provider placement
- `src/App.tsx` - Simplified structure
- `src/shared/context/TimerContext.tsx` - Unified timer context
- `src/presentation/hooks/useGlobalTimerTick.ts` - Global timer stabilization

### Components
- `src/presentation/pages/Projects.tsx` - Timer integration
- `src/presentation/components/Projects/ProjectCard.tsx` - Context usage
- `src/presentation/components/WorkdayTimer/WorkdayTimer.tsx` - Interval removal
- `src/presentation/components/Common/UnifiedTimerDemo.tsx` - Interval removal

### Use Cases
- `src/application/useCases/useStartTimer.ts` - Legacy interval removal
- `src/application/useCases/useActiveTask.ts` - **DELETED**

## Result

The timer system is now **stable and predictable**:

1. **Single global timer** (1Hz) that never multiplies
2. **Workday timer** decrements only when tasks are running
3. **Task timers** update live and persist correctly
4. **Navigation** doesn't affect timer behavior
5. **Clean Architecture** principles maintained
6. **No duplicate intervals** or timer conflicts

The system now provides a **reliable, single-source-of-truth timer** that works consistently across all pages and navigation scenarios.
